## Project Overview-

Shield Insurance provides affordable policies for all age groups and operates in cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Indore. They sell policies through multiple channels: offline agents, direct sales, a mobile app, and a website. The company offers a total of nine different policies. 

My task was to assist Shield Insurance in making data-driven decisions by analyzing their data from November 2022 to April 2023.

## Problem Statement-

Shield Insurance aims to enhance its data-driven decisions by implementing a dashboard that delivers clear and actionable insights.
To explore a partnership with AtliQ Technologies, they have proposed a pilot project to assess our capabilities.

This project will help them evaluate how effectively we can meet their requirements before moving forward with a full-scale implementation.
The outcome of this pilot will play a key role in determining the possibility of a larger, long-term collaboration.

## Dashboard Overview - 

I created a dashboard with three key sections:

**Home Page -** When a user logs in for the first time, they will land on this page. From here, they can navigate to different pages.

## Insights -

**1. Revenue and Customer Trends:** March 2023 recorded the highest revenue and customers, while November 2022 saw the lowest daily revenue and customer growth.

**2. Regional Revenue:** Delhi NCR region led with the highest revenue, whereas Indore contributed the least in both revenue and customer base.

**3. Top Age Group:** The 31-40 age group generated the highest revenue and had the largest number of customers.

**4. Lower-Contributing Age Groups:** Customers aged 18-24 and 25-30 contributed the least, representing just 8.67% of total revenue.

**5. Sales Channel Performance:** Offline agent channels performed best, generating 55.67% of the revenue and serving 55.41% of customers.

**6. Top Policy:** Policy ID - POL2005HEL generated the highest revenue despite being held by only 7.33% of customers.

**7. Lower-Revenue Policies:** Policy IDs - POL4321HEL and POL4331HEL collectively contributed just 5.96% of the revenue while covering 30.43% of customers.

**8. Claims Settlement:** Customers aged 31-40 had the highest settlement amounts, whereas those aged 18-24 and 25-30 had the lowest settlement needs.



## Recommendations -

**1. Boost Indore’s Growth:** Analyze local challenges and implement targeted marketing strategies to increase revenue and customer growth in Indore. Consider personalized offers and campaigns that appeal to the regional audience.

**2. Maximize Delhi NCR’s Potential:** Since Delhi NCR is the highest revenue-generating region, focus on offering tailored insurance plans for different age groups to maintain and expand the customer base.

**3. Engage Younger Customers:** Investigate why customers aged 18-30 show less interest in purchasing policies. Develop affordable and customized plans that meet their needs and financial situations to attract this age group.

**4. Expand Online Sales Channels:** Improve the website experience and invest in digital marketing campaigns to reach a wider audience. With most revenue coming from offline agents, there’s an opportunity to grow online sales significantly.

**5. Promote High-Performing Policies:** Focus on promoting high-revenue policies like POL2005HEL. Highlight their benefits through targeted campaigns to attract new customers and boost overall revenue.

**6. Target Top-Selling Cities with Localized Strategies:** Develop customized marketing campaigns for high-performing cities such as Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Chennai. Focus on region-specific customer preferences and needs to create personalized offers, ensuring maximum engagement and improved sales in these key markets.
